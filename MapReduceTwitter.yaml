Chains two MapReduce

MapReduce1
Map(a, b): # a -> b (a follows b)
  emit(a, <'follows', 'b'> )
  emit(b, <'followed by', 'a'> )

Reduce(userID, value):
  for val in value:
    if val[0] == "follows"
      following +=1
    elif val[0] == "followed by"
      followers +=1
      list_of_followers.append(val[1])

    if followers > 1M and following > 10:
      emit(userID, "follower > 1M and following > 10")

    if follower > 2M:
      for followers in list_of_followers:
        emit(follower, "follows someone with followers > 2M")

MapRead2
Map(userID, value):
  emit(key, value) # keys now all ordered at next reduce

Reduce(userID, value):
  if "follows someone with followers > 2M" and "follower > 1M and following > 10" in value:
    emit(key, '')
